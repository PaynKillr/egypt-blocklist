## 🇪🇬 Egypt DNS Threat Blocklist for AdGuard, Pi-hole & NextDNS

Let’s be real! most global DNS blocklists (shoutout Hagezi, OISD, etc.) are great… if you’re worried about international scams, crypto pump bots, and dodgy casino sites in Slovakia.

But if you’re in Egypt, trying to avoid:

	•	Fake Egypt Post delivery scams
	•	Phishing sites mimicking Banque Misr with a CSS file from 2009
	•	Spyware-ridden “courier” sites that ask for your card and national ID
	•	ISP-injected ad domains that shove crypto-mining into your nostrils

…then you’re basically the Last Guardian Standing in a Trials of Osiris game — and your ISP: "Hold my beer... and your connection."

So I built this:
A flat, aggressive-but-safe blocklist (updated weekly, kinda!) focused 100% on phishing, malware, spyware, and scam domains targeting Egyptian users.

This complements global lists (Hagezi, OISD), doesn't replace 'em. It's Egypt-first: less big tech solution, more highly localized DNS vendetta.
